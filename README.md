# Choret

Choret is an untyped choreographic programming language implemented as a DSL in Racket using macros. It is based on *Pirouette*, a functional choreographic programming language designed by Andrew K. Hirsch (my research advisor) and Deepak Garg. Their paper, *Pirouette: Higher-Order Typed Functional Choreographies*, can be found here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498684.
